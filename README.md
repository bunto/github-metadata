[github-metadata](https://rubygems.org/gems/bunto-github-metadata), a.k.a. `site.github`
=====================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bunto/github-metadata.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bunto/github-metadata)

Access `site.github` metadata anywhere (...you have an internet connection).

## Usage

Usage of this gem is pretty straight-forward. Add it to your bundle like this:

```ruby
gem 'bunto-github-metadata'
```

Now add it to your `_config.yml`:

```yaml
gems: ['bunto-github-metadata']
```

Then go ahead and run `bundle install`. Once you've done that bunto-github-metadata will run when you run Bunto.

In order for bunto-github-metadata to know what metadata to fetch it must
be able to determine the repository to ask GitHub about.

The easiest way to accomplish this is by setting an "origin" remote with a
github.com URL. If you ran `git clone` from GitHub, this is almost 100% the
case & no further action is needed. If you run `git remote -v` in your
repository, you should see your repo's URL.

If you don't have a git remote available, you have two other options:

1. Set the environment variable `PAGES_REPO_NWO` to your repository name
   with owner, e.g. `"bunto/github-metadata"`. This is useful if you don't
   want to commit your repository to your git history.
2. Add your repository name with organization to your site's configuration
   in the `repository` key.

```yaml
repository: username/repo-name
```

"NWO" stands for "name with owner." It is GitHub lingo for the username of
the owner of the repository plus a forward slash plus the name of the
repository, e.g. 'parkr/blog', where 'parkr' is the owner and 'blog' is the
repository name.

Your `site.github.*` fields should fill in like normal. If you run Bunto
with the `--verbose` flag, you should be able to see all the API calls
made.

## Authentication

For some fields, like `cname`, you need to authenticate yourself. Luckily it's pretty easy. You have 2 options:

### 1. `BUNTO_GITHUB_TOKEN`

These tokens are easy to use and delete so if you move around from machine-to-machine, we'd recommend this route. Set `BUNTO_GITHUB_TOKEN` to your access token (with `public_repo` scope) when you run `bunto`, like this:

```bash
$ BUNTO_GITHUB_TOKEN=123abc [bundle exec] bunto serve
```

### 2. `~/.netrc`

If you prefer to use the good ol' `~/.netrc` file, just make sure the `netrc` gem is bundled and run `bunto` like normal. So if I were to add it, I'd add `gem 'netrc'` to my `Gemfile`, run `bundle install`, then run `bundle exec bunto build`. The `machine` directive should be `api.github.com`.

### 3. Octokit

We use [Octokit](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb) to make the appropriate API responses to fetch the metadata. You may set `OCTOKIT_ACCESS_TOKEN` and it will be used to access GitHub's API.

```bash
$ OCTOKIT_ACCESS_TOKEN=123abc [bundle exec] bunto serve
```

## Overrides

- `PAGES_REPO_NWO` – overrides `site.repository` as the repo name with owner to fetch (e.g. `bunto/github-metadata`)

Some `site.github` values can be overridden by environment variables.

- `BUNTO_BUILD_REVISION` – the `site.github.build_revision`, git SHA of the source site being built. (default: `git rev-parse HEAD`)
- `PAGES_ENV` – the `site.github.pages_env` (default: `dotcom`)
- `PAGES_API_URL` – the `site.github.api_url` (default: `https://api/github.com`)
- `PAGES_HELP_URL` – the `site.github.help_url` (default: `https://help.github.com`)
- `PAGES_GITHUB_HOSTNAME` – the `site.github.hostname` (default: `https://github.com`)
- `PAGES_PAGES_HOSTNAME` – the `site.github.pages_hostname` (default: `github.io`)

## Configuration

Working with `bunto-github-metadata` and GitHub Enterprise? No sweat. You can configure which API endpoints this plugin will hit to fetch data.

- `SSL` – if "true", sets a number of endpoints to use `https://`, default: `"false"`
- `OCTOKIT_API_ENDPOINT` – the full hostname and protocol for the api, default: `https://api.github.com`
- `OCTOKIT_WEB_ENDPOINT` – the full hostname and protocol for the website, default: `https://github.com`
- `PAGES_PAGES_HOSTNAME` – the full hostname from where GitHub Pages sites are served, default: `github.io`.
- `NO_NETRC` – set if you don't want the fallback to `~/.netrc`
